# unmock-ts-koans

Koans are a great way to learn a new language or library. These koans will teach you how to use unmock in typescript.

## Running the koans

First, install the dependencies.

```bash
$ yarn
```

Then, run the first koan.

```bash
$ yarn test-1
```

It will fail, and there are comments in the [first test file](test/1-hello-unmock/1-a-simple-test.test.ts) with hints on how to fix it.

Once you get this koan to pass, congratulate yourself! Then, run the second koan.

```bash
$ yarn test-2
```

And so on and so forth until you have run all of the koans.

Then, when you are done, you can bask in the glory of lots of correct koans by running the following.

```bash
$ yarn test
```

## Sharing your work

If you've completed the koans and want to share your answers, just make a PR! Check out some of the branches for inspiration. Some people also use PRs for help if/when they get stuck - thanks to everyone who has given a hand.

## Contributing a new test

Some people that have shared their branches have added extra tests. If you want your test to be merged into the main branch, please make a PR to `master` with the "wrong" version and `answers` with the correction.
